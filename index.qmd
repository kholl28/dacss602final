# Project Description
<!--
With the growing research into the punitive nature of the 13th Amendment, 
sociologists have begun to question the ways in which we mistreat felons 
and those incarcerated. One significant inquiry is who will advocate for 
those currently serving time. In 26 states, it is legal to disenfranchise 
felons while in jail, and prevent them from ever voting again in specific municipalities once freed. 
To understand how felon enfranchisement would impact our general population, 
we first examine the factors leading to continuous felon disenfranchisement.

In our survey, we investigate how the severity of the crime and the intention 
for recidivism affect people’s perceptions of whether voting rights should be 
restored to a felon in prison. We hypothesize that the more severe the crime, 
the less likely someone is to have their enfranchisement rights restored while 
serving time and that if someone intends to recidvise they will be less likely 
to have their enfranchisement restored in prison. We also hypothesis that felons 
of color will dispropotionatly not be enfranchised while in prison due to bias 
ideas of crime rate, recidivism and negative ideologies attributed to people 
of color. We hypothesis that perceptions of felons also playing a major role in 
indicated how likely someone is towards voting for enfranchisement legislation. 
Those who know someone in prison, or have better ideas of felons will be more 
likely to vote in favor of enfranchising felon as opposed to those with lower 
ideas of felons. Additionally, we explore how  a respondent’s general attitudes towards 
felons moderate this relationship. If people generally hold negative perceptions
of felons, we inquire about the impact of providing information about felons and 
their recidivism rates on the chances of enfranchisement.

# plot shows that when shown a vignette of a felon who intends to recommit the crime once released from prison, independent of the severity of the crime committed or the race of the felon, respondents are more likely to not restore rights to the felon compared to respondents who received vignettes of felons who did NOT intend to recidivise.

# Interpretation
<!--

Discussion of Chi-Square Test:
We conducted Chi-Square tests on four distinct groups: Race of Felon vs. Vignette Response, 
Crime Severity vs. Vignette Response, Recidivism Intention vs. Vignette Response, 
and Incarceration History vs. Vignette Response. Among these, Race of Felon, Crime Severity, 
and Incarceration History yielded non-significant p-values. This indicates that we cannot reject 
the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant mean variance between the groups in these cases.
On the contrary, Recidivism Intention and Response displayed a P-Value of 0.01084, allowing us 
to reject the null hypothesis. This implies a discernible difference between the groups. 
Specifically, the intention of recidivism appears to influence the likelihood of voting in favor 
of enfranchisement. The significance of this finding underscores the impact that respondents' 
perceptions of an individual's likelihood to reoffend have on their stance toward enfranchisement.


Visualizations and Communication:
Examining bar graphs where results are segmented by variables and color-coded for interpretation 
reveals intriguing insights. The initial graph illustrates the connection between attitudes and 
vignette responses. Higher attitudes correlate with felons being more inclined to vote for enfranchisement. 
Divergent outcomes emerge across varying levels of crime severity. Notably, perceived non-violent 
crimes show little distinction from high-severity crimes. Conversely, crimes like robbery are 
perceived as more conducive to enfranchisement. Another finding indicates that race does not 
influence who is enfranchised. Non-white individuals are only marginally more likely to be 
re-enfranchised, with no significant difference. Turning our attention to recidivism intention, it 
plays a role in determining someone's likelihood of being re-enfranchised. Just over half of survey 
respondents, when informed about a defendant likely to recommit the crime post-release, voted against
enfranchising felons. This suggests that when negative information about felons is presented before 
voting, there's an almost 50-50 chance of a 'no' vote. Conversely, the intention not to recommit the 
crime resulted in 62% of respondents voting to enfranchise felons. When individuals have a genuine 
support system and are committed to rehabilitation, there's a higher likelihood of voting for enfranchisement, 
even while the individual is still in prison.

Social and Economic Considerations:
While we controlled for race and income, we believe another factor may explain the perception of 
armed robbery. Traditionally, crimes like robbery don't occur in a vacuum; they often stem from 
socioeconomic factors, where individuals, having limited options, resort to crime, unlike offenses 
such as tax evasion and pedophilia.

Suggestions for Future Research:
In future research, we aim to delve into specific points to gain a deeper understanding. First, 
we want to explore why armed robbery, considered a middle-severity crime, was perceived more 
favorably than tax evasion. Were our categorizations of non-violent crimes accurate, or do 
certain non-violent crime saliences predispose people to vote in a certain way? Now that we 
know race plays no significant role, further investigation into the three main groups of low, 
middle, and high severity crimes and how perception influences them is warranted.

Limitations of the Study:
Our study surveyed only 263 people, a sample size insufficient for extrapolating inferences about
the broader U.S. community. Furthermore, with 12 different groups, each consisting of fewer than
30 people, the sample distribution poses limitations. Additionally, the perception of crime severity
may vary; what we consider less severe might be perceived differently by others online.
